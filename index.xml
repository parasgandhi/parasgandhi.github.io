      <description>I am a passionate coder, and completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Bharati Vidyapeeth University, Pune. I love solving real world problems. The journeys towards the solutions have been more exciting than the destinations themselves.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a thing for Web and Mobile development, and not just their functionality but their aesthetics. For me it&amp;rsquo;s more like an art than science, always keeping up with new technologies, web frameworks and implementing their unique styles.</description>

Will make it public pretty soon&amp;hellip;</description>
